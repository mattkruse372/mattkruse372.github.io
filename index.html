        <h1 class = "about">About <em>Matt Kruse</em></h1>

        <p class = "intro">Hi! My name is Matt Kruse, and I am a senior at Bayport-Blue Point High School. I will be studying mechanical engineering at
            University at Buffalo in the fall of 2023. I am someone who loves to learn, especially when it comes to things that don't exist. I find the idea of space fascinating, and how the idea of what is outside space we do not know. For example, I often am wondering what there is past space, if there is anything. I wonder if we are just a small
             part of the world and if we are a part of a much larger thing; something so large that we can not merely grasp the concept of it. On top of these interests I have,
             I also love doing many things outside. I love being surrounded by nature, going on hikes, and photography. Some places I love to go to are Sans Soucci park in Sayville, New York and Shennendoah National Park. I
             went to the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park too, which I also highly reccomend, they are just very far away, so it is hard to travel too.
             Shennendoah I camped there twice (with a tent and campfire too, crazy) and it was lots of fun. It was how I spent my 16th birthday. I also love music and concerts, but this is a very broad trait of mine since I feel like everyone likes these things.
